1D Decomposition
    In 1D decomposition, the computational grid is divided along only one axis (row-wise or column-wise).
    Each MPI process is responsible for a continuous block of rows or columns, but not both.
MPI Decomposition:
    In 1D geometry, either px or py is set to 1:
    Example for 4 processes:
        px=1, py=4 (Column decomposition): 1D geometry, dividing the grid into 4 columns.
        px=4, py=1 (Row decomposition): 1D geometry, dividing the grid into 4 rows.
        
Communication:
    Simpler communication since neighboring processes only need to exchange data along one boundary (either rows or columns).
    Requires less MPI messaging compared to 2D geometry.
